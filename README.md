# BMI Calculator

"BMI calculator" is designed to calculate the Body Mass Index of a person. BMI is a value derived from the mass and height of a person.
The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
 
I used React to create the BMI Calculator.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the project: In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
