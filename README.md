# BMI Calculator

"BMI calculator" is designed to calculate the Body Mass Index of a person. BMI is a value derived from the mass and height of a person.
The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
 
I am using React to create the BMI Calculator.
